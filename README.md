# Predictive Financial Distress Modeling for Small Businesses using Python

**Overview:**

This project aims to develop a predictive model for identifying small businesses at risk of financial distress within the next 12 months.  The model leverages financial statement data to assess the probability of distress, allowing for proactive risk management and targeted interventions.  The analysis involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using various machine learning techniques.

**Technologies Used:**

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* (Add any other libraries used here)


**How to Run:**

1. **Clone the repository:**  `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the main script:** `python main.py`


**Example Output:**

The script will print key performance indicators and model evaluation metrics to the console.  Additionally, it will generate several visualizations, including:

* A plot showing sales trends over time (e.g., `sales_trend.png`).
* (Add other example plot files generated here)
* A summary report (e.g., `financial_summary.txt` or a similar file) that includes details of the analysis and prediction results for each business in the portfolio.

**Data:**

The project requires a dataset of financial statements for small businesses. This data should include relevant financial ratios and key performance indicators.  The specific data used in this project is not included in the repository (due to [reason - e.g., confidentiality, size]).  You will need to provide your own dataset in the format specified within the code.

**Further Development:**

Future work could involve exploring advanced machine learning techniques, incorporating external economic indicators, and developing a user-friendly interface for model deployment.
